# Description: Simple installer script which was built from looking at the RPM
# spec file. This allows petit to be installed on other unix-like operating
# systems such as OSX, Solaris, etc. It has not been test on every platform,
# but it is fairly simple and should work on most.
# 
# You must be root to run this script
