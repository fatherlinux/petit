"""Hash drivers: SuperHash and the per-format classes that fingerprint entries.

A hash driver turns each parsed entry into a fingerprint key. It declares
three things and inherits the rest:

- KEY_FIELDS: which LogEntry fields make up the key.
- GENERALIZATIONS: (pattern, replacement) rules for the format's phrases.
- DEFAULT_FILTER: the stopword file used unless the caller supplies one.

The rule for GENERALIZATIONS:

    A generalization is a claim that everything after this phrase is a
    parameter, not a message. Normalize what the FORMAT generated; keep
    what a HUMAN wrote.

Ask two questions of a rule. Does it collapse a token or a phrase?
Token-level rules — timestamps, addresses, hex, PIDs — are always safe; a
token cannot carry a sentence. Phrase-level rules are allowed only when the
tail they swallow is drawn from a bounded, machine-generated vocabulary.
Then: what is the widest thing this rule's `.*` can swallow? If the format
permits free text there, the rule is too wide. docs/drivers.md has more.

        of boot noise read as one line and whatever was unusual stands out.

        Corpora of related systems share most of their lines, so presence
