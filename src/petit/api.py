"""Library entry points — petit's analysis without petit's command line.

Everything here takes text — a string, or lines one at a time — returns
data, and raises on failure. No file paths, no stdout, no sys.exit. The CLI is one caller of this
module; a service embedding petit is another, and neither should have to
route a payload through a temporary file or lose its process to a bad line.

    from petit.api import hash_lines

    with open("/var/log/messages") as log:
        for group in hash_lines(log):
            print(group.count, group.pattern)

The text is first cut into records — lines, JSON objects, or email
messages — by the first framer in `petit.records` that claims it. For line
records `CrunchLog` samples the buffer, each registered driver votes, and
the winner parses every record. Adding a driver to `CrunchLog` makes it
available here automatically.

    Deterministic: the same text yields the same analysis every time.

    Args:
        text: The log or payload to analyse.
        filter_name: Stopword file to apply, resolved from packaged data.
            None, the default, asks the hash driver: each one declares the
            normalisation that suits its format (`DEFAULT_FILTER`). Pass
            "__none__" for no filtering at all. Ignored when `stopwords` is
            given.
        stopwords: Regexes to normalise with, supplied by the caller and
            used instead of any packaged file. The packaged hash.stopwords
            is tuned for system logs and is deliberately aggressive —
            `[a-f]+#` collapses letters adjacent to a scrubbed number, so
            "bob0" and "boa0" group together. A caller that needs two
            distinct values to stay distinct supplies its own list.
            Each entry is a regex, replaced with "#", or a
            (regex, replacement) pair when the fingerprint should say what
            was normalised away — "<TS>" and "<IP>" rather than "#".
        max_samples: Real lines to retain per group.
        source_name: Label used in errors and logging.
        driver: Pin an entry class by name (e.g. "RawEntry") instead of
            detecting one. A caller that needs grouping to be purely
            structural — no per-format vocabulary applied to its payloads —
            pins RawEntry and gets exactly that.
        strict: Raise ParseError when the driver meets a line it cannot
            parse, instead of falling back to RawEntry.
        hash_mode: What to group by. "auto" fingerprints each line with the
            hash driver for its format; "daemon" and "host" group by those
            fields; "wordcount" counts words.
        collapse_fingerprints: Replace every known routine event sequence
            (a reboot) found in the text with one group named after it.
            Off by default because it deletes lines. What matched is
            reported in `Analysis.fingerprints_matched`.
        framer: How to cut the text into records: "json" (a JSON array of
            objects or JSON Lines), "message" (RFC 822 mail), "multiline"
            (log messages whose continuation lines, such as a stack trace,
            join the timestamped line above them) or "line". "auto", the
            default, lets each claim the text in that order.
        max_record_chars: Longest text a record's fingerprint key is built
            from. Bounds the work stopword rules do on hostile input.
            Samples and raw text are never truncated.

    Raises:
        EmptyLogError: `text` contained no data.
        ParseError: only when `strict`, or when `driver` was pinned and
            could not parse the text.
        DataFileError: `filter_name` was given but could not be read.
        PetitError: `driver`, `hash_mode` or `framer` is not a known name,
