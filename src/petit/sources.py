"""Where lines come from: a string, a file, a pipe.

petit reads its input as a stream of lines and never holds all of it. Some
inputs can be read again from the start — a file, a string, a list — and
petit reads those in several passes: one to decide how to frame them, one
to pick a driver, one to parse. A pipe can be read once. See LogStream for
what petit does with each.

Lines keep their newline, as iterating a file in text mode gives them, and
every source applies universal newlines: `\\r\\n` and `\\r` end a line.
