How
===============================================================================
The test script test.sh iterates each major functiona and each data file
comparing the output to a known output which is saved in a data file. If the 
output is different from the last known good output, then the test fails.

These tests do not prove that the petit is flawless but rather that it can
survive all of the stresses that I have encountered. The idea is to add more
tests over time to improve the quality.

It is often necessary to update the test files, files can be updated by calling
test with the update option like so

	test.sh update
