## [Unreleased]

## [4.9.0] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed
- `words.stopwords` matched its words anywhere inside a word, not as the
  whole word, so `--wordcount` cut them out of other words. "target"
  became `tar#`, "command" became `comm#`, and 55 of the listed words
  didn't even stop themselves ("there" became `t#e`). Each word now
  matches only as a whole word, in any case, with punctuation around it
  allowed.
- `hash.stopwords` let through noise that differs from one boot or machine
  to the next, measured against two reboots of every supported release and
  one real-hardware RHEL 10 reboot:
  - UUIDs in upper case, or with a group made only of letters
  - vfat volume serials (`F96D-44AD`) and `0x` hex values
  - Python tempfile and snap mount names
  - negative numbers and decimals
  Keys from two boots of the same image now agree more closely (69
  unstable keys down to 43). Of the fingerprint lines the real laptop
  reboot missed, the ones missed only through normalisation went from 10
  down to 1.

### Changed
- `--wordcount` also drops English one- and two-letter words, bare
  punctuation, empty audit fields (`addr=?`), whole UUIDs, and systemd's
  lifecycle words ("Started", "Stopped", "Reached", "target",
  "Deactivated", "successfully" and so on). These filled the top of every
  modern reboot's count.
- `daemon.stopwords` rules for classic syslog pseudo-daemons ("last
  message repeated", "-- MARK --") now match only the whole field.
- Removed two `hash.stopwords` rules that could never match: `[a-f]{16}`
  and a literal MAC address.

## [4.8.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- Reboot fingerprint corpora for current Linux (#37): `el8`, `el9`, `el10`
  (captured on AlmaLinux), `fedora44`, `debian12`, `debian13`,
  `ubuntu22.04`, `ubuntu24.04`, `ubuntu26.04`, `opensuse-leap16`, `arch`
  and `alpine`. The 2009–2011 corpora never matched a systemd journal, so
  `--fingerprint` did nothing on a modern host. Each corpus has a second,
  independent reboot in `test/data/verify/` that must name it first. Rocky
  and CentOS Stream verify the `elN` corpora, and Fedora 43 and Alpine 3.23
  verify the newest release's corpus.
- `tools/fingerprints/refresh.py` and the weekly `fingerprints.yml`
  workflow keep the reboot corpora current, the way Dependabot keeps
  dependencies current (#37). Each supported release is booted from its
  own cloud image under QEMU/KVM and its reboot captured and scrubbed. A PR
  opens when a release is new, when its reboot no longer matches its
  corpus, or when it reaches end of life.

### Removed
- `petit/data/fingerprint_library/`, the 2009–2011 per-machine reboot logs
  the old corpora were merged from by hand. Nothing read them. Corpora now
  come from `tools/fingerprints/refresh.py`, and each one's independent
  second capture is kept in `test/data/verify/`.

## [4.7.0] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- Fingerprint corpora are voted on rather than tried largest first (#49).
  A corpus is present when more than 31% of its lines are, as before, and
  at least five of them. Among those present, the one that best accounts
  for the input wins. The score is a weighted F1 in which a line many
  corpora share counts for little, so the lines one distribution alone
  logs decide. When nothing in the input tells two corpora apart, both
  are named in one label, `a|b`, rather than one being guessed. The
  winner's lines are then set aside and the rest vote again, so two
  reboots in one log both collapse.

### Fixed
- A rhel5 reboot was also labelled `rhel4-reboot.fp`, and an ubuntu9.04
  reboot `ubuntu10.04-reboot.fp`. The larger corpus claimed the reboot
  first, then the right one matched what was left.

### Added
- `Analysis.fingerprint_scores` lists a `FingerprintScore` (name,
  detection, identity) for every corpus that was present, so a caller can
  see the vote behind `fingerprints_matched`. `-v` logs the same.

## [4.6.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- Native packages (#48): a noarch `.rpm` for RHEL 8, 9 and 10 and their
  rebuilds, Fedora, Amazon Linux 2023 and SUSE, and an `all` `.deb` for
  Debian 12 and 13 and Ubuntu 24.04 and 26.04. Each release attaches them,
  and the signed dnf and apt repository at crunchtools.github.io/packages
  serves them, so `dnf upgrade` and `apt upgrade` pick up new versions.
  petit installs to `/usr/lib/petit` and runs on whichever Python 3.11 or
  newer the system has, so RHEL 8 and 9 use their `python3.12` package.
- CI tests Python 3.11 through 3.14 (#51).

## [4.5.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- `analyze_lines()` and `hash_lines()` take lines one at a time — an open
  file, a pipe, a generator — so an embedder can analyse a log without
  reading it into a string (#38).

### Changed
- petit streams its input in bounded memory (#38, replacing #5). It used to
  read the whole input into one string, build an entry for every line and
  keep every entry in its groups: 1.4 GB of memory for a 96 MB, 1M-line
  secure log. It now keeps each group's count and a few samples, and the
  same log takes 28 MB for `--hash` and every graph and 36 MB for
  `--wordcount`, and still 28 MB for a 384 MB, 4M-line log. Output is byte-identical
  for every mode and fixture.
- A file is read in passes: every framer surveys it line by line, the
  drivers vote on records sampled across the whole of it, then it is
  parsed. Framing and driver choice are exactly what they were.
- A pipe is read once. petit holds its first 4 MB (`HEAD_CHARS`, the same
  as the JSON framer's limit); a pipe that ends there is read exactly like
  a file. A longer one is framed and parsed by what its first 4 MB chose,
  and a later record the driver can't read falls back to `RawEntry` on its
  own rather than sending the whole input back to be re-read.
- `--graph` finds its range and counts in one pass, keeping counts per
  time bucket and merging buckets once they are too fine to be drawn.
- `--hash` is about 25% faster and `--wordcount` more than twice as fast:
  `Filter.scrub()` built a debug log message for every stopword on every
  key even when debug logging was off, and `--wordcount` scrubs each
  distinct word once.

### Fixed
- The container image's `version` label said 3.1.1.

## [4.4.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- `SyslogEntry` and `SecureLogEntry` accept fractional seconds, so
  `journalctl -o short-precise` (`Sep 23 16:55:34.125733`) is read as
  syslog instead of falling back to `RawEntry` (#45). The clock column still
  has to be a whole `HH:MM:SS`, optionally followed by `.` and 1-9 digits;
  `10:00` and `x10:00:01` are still rejected (#2).
- `RSyslogEntry` found the clock by splitting on `-`, which only works west
  of UTC: any `+hh:mm` offset or `Z` raised `ValueError`, and so did a
  fraction of anything but six digits, and one such line sank the whole log
  to `RawEntry` (#11). It now matches the whole RFC 3339 timestamp, and its
  vote requires the whole first column to be one.
- Fixtures test19 (`short-precise` journal, same content as test16: its hash
  and graph output are identical) and test20 (RFC 3339 with `+02:00`,
  `+05:30`, `Z`, `-0400` and 1-9 digit fractions).

## [4.4.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- `multiline` framer (`--framer multiline`, tried automatically after
  `json` and `message`). A record starts at a line that begins with a
  timestamp, and every other line belongs to the record above it, so a
  journalctl stack trace, a Python traceback or a Java exception with
  `Caused by:` is one record. It recognises 16 timestamp formats: syslog
  and journalctl, RFC 3339/5424, Python logging, log4j/logback, Go, nginx,
  Apache error and access, Snort, Kubernetes/glog, the kernel, Unix time,
  java.util.logging, Tomcat, US dates, Redis and logback's time-only layout.
  journald's `-- Boot ... --` lines are skipped.
- README section "How petit reads a log": the framer, entry driver and
  hash driver stages, what a record is, and a worked multi-line example.
  docs/drivers.md documents the framer's rules and every timestamp format.
- Fixtures test16 (journalctl), test17 (Python traceback) and test18 (Java
  exception).

### Changed
- `journalctl -o short` output with multi-line messages used to fall back
  to `RawEntry` as a whole, because its continuation lines have no time:
  four days of a Fedora journal, 367,070 lines, graphed as nothing. It now
  frames as 365,928 records read by `SyslogEntry`. Any input the new
  framer claims groups per message instead of per line. It claims only
  input with an indented continuation line; everything else, including all
  of test01-test15, frames exactly as before.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-09-23

### Changed
- `--graph` sizes the graph to the log and the terminal instead of picking
  one of the six fixed windows. It runs from the earliest entry to the
  latest and uses the finest column size that fits: 1/5/15/30 seconds,
  1/5/15/30 minutes, 1/2/3/6/12 hours, 1/2/7 days, 1/3/6 months or 1/5/10
  years. Three and a half days of syslog is 84 one-hour columns on a
  120-column terminal and 42 two-hour columns on 80, where 4.2.0 drew 31
  day columns, 27 of them empty. Multi-unit columns start on round values
  (:00/:15, even hours, quarters) and the Duration line names the column
  size, e.g. `98 hours (2-hour columns)`. Released in 4.2.0 earlier today,
  and still promises what it did: the whole log, fitted to the terminal.
- Graphs keep two characters of the terminal for the axis labels, which
  print past the last column. A `--span` that filled the terminal exactly
  wrapped its labels; it now exits 2 like any other span that doesn't fit.
- `--help` and the README describe every graph in the same terms: the unit,
  the number of columns, what the axis labels mean. New README section,
  "Graphs".

### Fixed
- `--graph` started at the first line, so a log out of time order lost
  every entry before it (test01: 100 of 115 lines). It now starts at the
  earliest entry.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- `--graph` picks the finest of the six fixed graphs whose window, starting
  at the first entry, reaches the latest entry (#6). Lines stamped with the
  1900 placeholder year do not stretch the span.
- `--span N{s,m,h,d,mo,y}` graphs exactly N units from the first entry,
  e.g. `--span 90m`. It implies `--graph`, needs at least 6 units, and must
  fit the terminal width (`--wide` doubles each column); otherwise exit 2.

### Changed
- The six graph classes share one constructor in `GraphHash`; each now only
  names its unit and window. Entries are counted with a dict lookup instead
  of a scan of the window per line.

### Fixed
- A leftover debug `print` wrote a stray number above the graph whenever the
  window had empty buckets (20 fixtures).
- `--mograph` and `--ygraph` stepped by 365/12 and 365 days, so two buckets
  could land in the same month or year: "12 months" drew 11 columns, "10
  years" drew 9, and End Time drifted (`2010-07-02 14:00:00`). They now
  step on the calendar, draw every bucket, and end on the first of the
  month or year.
- The middle axis label never printed on odd-width graphs, including
  `--dgraph`, because its position was compared as a float.

Every `*graph.output` fixture that changed was regenerated and its diff
reviewed: only the stray number, the column counts, the axis labels and
End Time moved.

## [4.1.2] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- `SyslogEntry` and `SecureLogEntry` detection checked the clock column with
  a malformed character class (`[0-9{2}:...`), so fields like `10:00` or
  `x10:00:01` passed as a time. The column must now be exactly `HH:MM:SS`.
  A driver no longer gets picked for lines it cannot unpack (#2).

## [4.1.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- `--wordcount` (and `hash_mode="wordcount"`) undercounted words that
  normalize to the same key, such as `web01`/`web02` or `eth0`/`eth1`. The
  merge concatenated the two `[count, members]` lists instead of adding
  them, so the group kept the first word's count and lost the rest. Counts
  now add up and sample lines are pooled (#33). Every `*-wordcount.output`
  fixture was regenerated and checked against an independent per-word
  tally.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added
- `EmailEntry` and `EmailHash`: messages cut out by `MessageFramer` are
  fingerprinted by skeleton: header names (never values), quote-depth
  profile, signature present or not, and the unquoted body lines, which are
  token-normalized by `strict.stopwords` and never generalized. Two replies
  that say the same thing merge whoever sent them, and one that says
  something else never does. MERGE/NO_MERGE table in `test/test_drivers.py`.

### Changed
- Mail threads and mbox input are parsed by `EmailEntry` instead of
  `RawEntry`. Reviewed fixture diff: `test15-hash*.output`, where the two
  identical "Looking now." replies now group together.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-09-22

### Changed
- **Breaking: input is framed into records before driver selection.**
  `--framer {auto,line,json,message}` and `analyze_text(framer=...)` default
  to `auto` for both the CLI and the library, so `petit --hash big.json` and
  `petit --hash thread.eml` now group per JSON object and per message rather
  than per line. `--framer line` restores the old behaviour. test01–test13
  are byte-identical: no framer but the line framer claims them.
- **Breaking: `Analysis.lines_in` and `lines_grouped` count source lines.**
  `lines_in` is the number of lines in the input, and `lines_grouped` is the
  number of source lines covered by grouped records, each line counted once.
  With one record per line both are unchanged. `records_in`,
  `records_grouped` and `framer` are new.
- `SuperHash.manufacture()` looks the hash driver up in a `HASH_FOR` table
  along the entry class's MRO, replacing an if/elif over the class of the
  last entry. A subclass of an entry driver now gets its parent's hash
  driver instead of whichever branch matched first. A characterization test
  pins every existing entry driver to the hash driver the old chain chose.
- Driver detection looks at the first 2000 characters of a record
  (`DETECT_MAX_CHARS`).

### Added
- `petit.records`: `Record`, `JsonFramer` (JSON arrays of objects and JSON
  Lines), `MessageFramer` (mail threads and mbox), `LineFramer`.
- `StructuredEntry` and `StructuredHash`: JSON records are fingerprinted by
  shape, with keys verbatim, values normalized by type, and strings of 200
  characters or fewer kept verbatim so that prose can't merge away.
- `analyze_text(max_record_chars=4096)`: bounds the text a fingerprint key is
  built from. Samples and raw text are never truncated.
- `Group.sample_spans`: the source lines each sample's record covered.
- `test/data/test14.log` (JSON array) and `test15.log` (mail thread) with
  fixtures, `test/test_records.py`, and `test/test_hostile.py`: deep nesting,
  oversized records, pathological regex probes, and odd bytes, each with a
  time budget.
- Constitution 1.1.0: a hostile-input clause in Testing, and the rule that the
  CLI is a shell over the library.

### Fixed
- The man page documented `--fingerprint` as `--finterprint`.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-09-22

### Changed
- The CLI is now a thin shell over `petit.api`: every `--hash`, `--daemon`,
  `--host` and `--wordcount` run is `analyze_text()` on the file's text.
  `test/output/*` is byte-identical across this refactor.
- Hash drivers own their normalization. Each declares `KEY_FIELDS`,
  `GENERALIZATIONS` and `DEFAULT_FILTER`, and `analyze_text`/`hash_text`'s
  `filter_name` now defaults to `None`, meaning "ask the driver". Explicit
  `filter_name=` or `stopwords=` still win. The rule for what a
  generalization may swallow is in `LogHash.py`'s docstring and the new
  `docs/drivers.md`.
- Raw text (`RawLogHash`) now normalizes with the new `strict.stopwords`
  instead of `hash.stopwords`, so identifiers like `web01`/`web02` and
  `PROJ-1234`/`PROJ-1235` stay distinct. Reviewed fixture diff:
  `test04-hash-nosample.output` (`#` → `<N>`).
- `SecureLogHash` keeps the user name the client supplied. `Invalid user.*`
  and `Failed password for.*from.*` (and `Failed password for invalid
  user.*`) swallowed the name and everything after it; they now collapse only
  the source address, and a name containing a space doesn't match at all.
  The `input_userauth_request: invalid user` and `error retrieving
  information about user` rules were removed for the same reason. No
  fixture moves: test08 contains none of these lines.
- `--allsample` shows each group's first member instead of a random one.

### Added
- `analyze_text(hash_mode="auto"|"daemon"|"host"|"wordcount")`: every
  grouping the CLI offers is reachable from the library.
- `analyze_text(collapse_fingerprints=True)` and
  `Analysis.fingerprints_matched`: reboot-sequence collapsing, previously
  CLI-only (`--fingerprint`).
- `Group.sample_payloads`: each sample's message without its envelope.
- `strict.stopwords`, and filter files may give a replacement per rule as
  `regex<TAB>replacement` (a bare regex still means `#`).
- `test/test_drivers.py`: MERGE/NO_MERGE example pairs for every hash driver.

### Fixed
- Fingerprint corpora were re-read and re-parsed from disk on every call;
  they are now cached by path and modification time. Matching no longer
  overwrites the corpus's own entry in place.
- Site-local fingerprint corpora (`/var/lib/petit/fingerprints/` etc.) were
  never read, because only the first directory with files was searched and
  the packaged one always has files. All directories are now read.
- A misspelt or missing filter name silently filtered nothing; it now raises
  `DataFileError`.
- Files and strings split into lines the same way. `from_text` used
  `str.splitlines()`, which also breaks on form feeds and U+2028, and
  `\r\n` input kept a trailing `\r` in its samples.
- A file that isn't valid UTF-8 exits 1 with a message instead of a
  traceback.
- `--wordcount` groups now hold the lines each word came from, so library
  samples are real lines rather than the word repeated.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed
- The 3.1.0 PyPI upload was rejected (trusted publisher was registered as a
  new-project pending publisher instead of on the existing project's
  Publishing settings). While fixing this on PyPI, the distribution name
  changed to `petit-log-crunchtools`, matching the naming convention
  already used elsewhere in the crunchtools fleet (`gatehouse-crunchtools`,
  `mcp-gemini-crunchtools`). `petit --version` now looks up the installed
  package under the new name; it would otherwise report "unknown" once
  installed from PyPI.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-09-20

### Changed
- Relicensed from GPL-3.0-or-later to AGPL-3.0-or-later, per the
  [crunchtools constitution](https://github.com/crunchtools/constitution).
  Scott McCarty is the sole copyright holder.
- Raised the minimum supported Python from 3.9 to 3.11, matching the
  constitution's CLI Tool profile.
- Rewrote the CLI argument parser from `optparse` to `argparse` (profile
  mandates argparse; `optparse` is legacy stdlib). Every flag, default, and
  the `--help` text are unchanged; the mode dispatch no longer uses `eval()`.
- Added type annotations across the library so `mypy --strict` passes with
  zero errors.
- Converted `CHANGELOG` (RPM-style) to `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog).

### Added
- `.github/workflows/`: CI (lint, mypy, pytest on 3.11/3.12, Gourmand,
  container build, constitution validation), a weekly security scan (CVE
  audit + CodeQL), dual-registry container publishing (Quay.io + GHCR), and
  PyPI trusted publishing on release tags.
- `Containerfile` on the Hummingbird multi-stage build pattern.
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` declaring the CLI Tool profile.
- `gourmand.toml` / `gourmand-exceptions.toml`.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` for the `uv` and `github-actions` ecosystems.
- `uv.lock`, committed per constitution XV.
- `test/test_cli.py`: CLI integration tests covering the exit code contract
  (0/1/2) and byte-for-byte output regression against the existing
  `test/data`/`test/output` fixtures.

### Fixed
- `petit --version` printed a hardcoded `2.0.0` since the 2.0.0 release; it
  now reports the installed package version.

### Removed
- The legacy `Makefile`, `build/` (rpm/deb/tar/distutils scripts), and
  `distribute/` directories — superseded by `uv build` + CI.
- `src/petit/ScriptLog.py`: dead code, unreferenced by the package and
  unimportable under Python 3 (`import sha`, a Python 2-only module) since
  the 2.0.0 port.
- `test/test.sh`: superseded by `test/test_cli.py`.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-19

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: the import package is now `petit`, not `crunchtools`. Update
  `from crunchtools import hash_text` to `from petit import hash_text`.
- **BREAKING**: the PyPI distribution is now `petit-log`, not `crunchtools`.
  `crunchtools` was this project's brand, not this tool's name — spending it
  on one log analyser left nothing for anything else that ships under it,
  and meant the repo, the distribution, the import and the command were
  four different words for one program. `petit` alone was unavailable on
  PyPI (a protein engineering toolkit holds it), hence `petit-log`.
- The repository moved to `github.com/crunchtools/petit`.
- The `petit` command and every flag are unchanged, as is the library API
  beyond the import path: `hash_text`, `analyze_text`, `detect_format`,
  `Group`, `Analysis`, and the `PetitError` hierarchy all behave exactly as
  in 2.2.0.
- `crunchtools` 2.1.0 remains on PyPI and is not superseded by an upload;
  the name is being kept for a future package under that brand.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-19

### Changed
- Made driver selection deterministic. `select()` drew its sample lines
  with `random.choice()`, so the driver — and therefore the entire result —
  was a function of the RNG as well as the input. The same bytes could
  parse two different ways, or succeed on one call and raise on the next.
  It now samples evenly spaced lines, which is reproducible and, because it
  always looks at the head and the tail, better evidence than a random
  draw.
- A line the selected driver cannot parse no longer aborts the run. The
  driver is chosen from a sample and then applied to every line, so one
  stack trace in an application log, or one prose line in mixed tool
  output, used to raise `ParseError` and lose the other four hundred
  lines. It now falls back to `RawEntry` and reports `Analysis.degraded`.
  Pass `strict=True` for the old behaviour.
- Samples are now the original lines, byte for byte. They were rebuilt
  from parsed fields, which invented data: formats carrying no timestamp
  were rendered with a placeholder `01 01 01:01:01 # #` envelope they
  never had.
- `SecureLogHash` no longer mutates the log it is fingerprinting. `fill()`
  assigned its generalised form back onto each entry, so hashing a secure
  log destroyed it for every later reader — the user name and source
  address, the only reason to read a sample, were gone. The rules now
  build the key from a local copy.

### Fixed
- Fixed `select()` re-counting votes across rounds. One `Tally` was reused
  while the sample list grew, so round three weighed the first ten lines
  three times.

### Added
- Added `analyze_text()`, which returns the groups plus the driver used,
  whether it degraded, and lines in versus lines grouped, so a caller can
  account for every line rather than wonder where they went.
- Added a `driver=` argument to pin an entry class instead of detecting
  one. A caller that must not have per-format vocabulary applied to its
  payloads pins `RawEntry` and gets purely structural grouping. Unknown
  names raise `PetitError`.
- Added a `stopwords=` argument taking regexes from the caller, used
  instead of any packaged filter file. Normalisation policy belongs to
  whoever reads the output: `hash.stopwords` is tuned for system logs and
  deliberately aggressive, and its `[a-f]+#` rule collapses letters next
  to a scrubbed number, so "bob0" and "boa0" group together. Right for
  spotting a flapping daemon, wrong for a caller that needs two distinct
  values to stay distinct.
- `stopwords=` entries may be `(regex, replacement)` pairs as well as bare
  regexes, so a fingerprint can say what it normalised away: `<TS> host
  sshd[<N>]: login from <IP>` rather than `# host sshd[#]: login from #`.
  Patterns loaded from a file keep the `#` scrub character petit has
  always used.
- Added `Group.sample_lines`, the 0-based position of each sample in the
  input. Grouping throws the original order away, so a caller that wants
  to show samples in written order rather than in group order had no way
  back.
- `hash_text()` and `detect_format()` are unchanged for existing callers,
  and the petit command line produces byte-identical output on the full
  test corpus.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added
- Added a library API: `crunchtools.hash_text()` and
  `crunchtools.detect_format()`.
- Added `CrunchLog.from_text()` so callers can analyse a string without a
  file.
- Packaged with `pyproject.toml` as the `crunchtools` distribution on
  PyPI, with `petit` as a console script. The name "petit" on PyPI belongs
  to an unrelated project.

### Fixed
- Fixed an infinite loop in `select()`: a buffer no driver claimed (blank
  lines, for instance) spun forever and grew its sample list on every
  pass. Bounded to `MAX_SELECT_ROUNDS` with a fall back to `RawEntry`.
- Fixed a missing comma in the fingerprint prefix list that joined two
  paths into one, so `/opt` was never actually searched.
- Made 7 regex literals raw (`SyntaxWarning` today, `SyntaxError` on a
  future Python) and escaped a literal `[` in a character class.
- Fixed #16: an unreadable or missing file escaped as a `PermissionError`
  traceback. It now raises `DataFileError`, which the CLI reports as
  `petit: cannot read <path>: Permission denied` and exits 1. Reported by
  Pablo Iranzo Gomez in 2022.
- The petit command line is unchanged: `--hash`, `--daemon`, `--host` and
  `--wordcount` all behave exactly as before.

### Removed
- Removed all 13 `sys.exit()` calls from library code; they raise
  `PetitError` subclasses now, and only the CLI turns those into an exit
  status.
- Removed `eval()` from the driver-detection path; `entry_types` holds the
  classes rather than their names. Auto-registration of new drivers is
  unchanged.
- Dropped the `sys.path` and `warnings.simplefilter` side effects from
  package import; a library should not mutate global state when it is
  imported.

### Changed
- Fingerprints and stopwords now ship inside the package and resolve
  through `importlib.resources`, so a pip install has its data. They were
  only ever installed to `/var/lib/petit` by the distro packaging, which
  meant filtering silently did nothing anywhere else.

## [2.0.0] - 2022-10-13

### Changed
- Ported to Python 3.
- Cleaned up to PEP 8 and added the `Tally` class to simplify
  driver-selection logic (committed 2011-04-16, the day after the 1.1.1
  tag, so it waited here).
- Reorganised the directory structure.
- (Recorded retroactively in 2026 — this release shipped without a
  changelog entry at the time.)

### Fixed
- Fixed Test 12; the suite passes again.

### Not merged during this period
Proposed but not merged, so none of it is in the code. Recorded because
the history is otherwise invisible; all four were opened by Pablo Iranzo
Gomez (iranzo) in Oct 2022 and closed unmerged in Nov 2024:
- #12 packaging for PyPI. Published independently as `petitlog` 2.0.0.post3
  on 2022-10-17 — https://pypi.org/project/petitlog/ — which is why that
  name is taken. It is this project, credited to Scott McCarty, and is
  unrelated to the `crunchtools` distribution published in 2026.
- #14 GitHub Actions to help with release tagging.
- #15 pre-commit configuration, applied across the code.
- #17 permission check in CrunchLog.py to avoid a traceback on unreadable
  files (closes #16).

## [1.1.1] - 2011-04-15

### Added
- Added `re.escape` to variable based regex.
- Added debugging output for graph.
- Added patch for bug with determining month.
- Added empty log data test, new test output for broken apache error log,
  and new test files.
- Added path for logs with no data.
- Added try/catch for interspersed wrong data problem.
- Added better documentation for rsyslog.

### Fixed
- Fixed index bug in syslog entry and rsyslog.

### Changed
- Updated outputs for new patch and year change.
- Updated description of tests.

## [1.1.0] - 2010-11-09

### Changed
- Finished conversion of crunchtools to a module.
- Passes all tests again.

## [1.0.4] - 2010-11-08

### Fixed
- Updated version because of a problem with rpdb2.

## [1.0.3] - 2010-06-25

### Fixed
- Patched to allow mixed precision when Ubuntu 8.04 logs to an Ubuntu
  10.04 server with high precision.

## Pre-1.0 history

These predate version numbering — the original changelog recorded them by
date only, with no corresponding git tag or release number. Dates are
preserved here rather than assigned invented version numbers.

### 2010-06-24
- Added support for rsyslogd precision time format.
- Added fingerprints for Ubuntu 10.04.
- Added NAME section to man page.

### 2010-02-27
- Added apache error log support and tests.
- Added man page.
- Added fingerprints for Ubuntu 9.04.

### 2010-02-12
- Moved a bunch of code into the `select` function of the Log object so
  that it can now randomly sample ten entries over and over until it
  determines what kind of file has been opened.
- Now passes all regression tests, all the time.

### 2010-01-18
- Changed defaults for entries to 1900 so that time delta calculations do
  not fail.
- Changed log determination logic to use multiple samples.
- Fixed bug in SecureLog processing where sample line was not being
  checked for long enough line.
- Added string conversion to all known log types to resolve type bugs
  casting strings and numbers.

### 2010-01-15
- Added Linux secure log processing capabilities.
- Added month graph and year graph (syslog carries no year data, so
  don't draw wrong conclusions from either).
- Added year support in code.
- Added Days graph.
- Added normalization code for better differentiation of close values,
  handling most edge cases.
- Removed first sample, replaced by random sampling for log type
  determination (later made deterministic in 2.2.0).
- Completely revamped date delta code using `datetime` built-in
  functionality to calculate date/time ranges.
- Re-architected and redesigned graphing logic and output to better match
  cacti/RRD. Kept graphing as separate classes per graph type rather than
  a more "object-oriented" hierarchy — closer to report writing than
  inheritance.
- Fixed documentation/help menu text.
- Fixed bug in value calculations of each bar of graph; values were
  erroring low.

### 2009-07-31
- First working version.
