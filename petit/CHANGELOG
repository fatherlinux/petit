* Fri Feb 12 2010 Scott McCarty <smccarty@eyemg.com>
- Moved a bunch of code into the select function of the Log object so that it can now randomly sample ten entries over and over until it determines what kind of file has been opened
- Now passes all regression tests, all the time :-)

* Mon Jan 18 2010 Scott McCarty <smccarty@eyemg.com>
- Changed defaults for entries to 1900 so that time delta calculations do not fail
- Changed log determination logic to use multiple samples                         
- Fixed bug in SecureLog processing where sample line was not being checked for long enough line
- Added string conversion to all known log types to resolve type bugs cating strings and numbers

* Fri Jan 15 2010 Scott McCarty <smccarty@eyemg.com>
- Removed first sample, replaced by random
- Added Linux secure log processing capabilities
- Changed to random sampling for log type determiniation
- Fixed documentation/help menu text
- Added month graph, caveat: syslog does not store year data, so don't reach wrong conclusions
- Added year graph for completeness, same warning as month                                    
- Added year support in code
- Fixed bug in value calculations of each bar of graph, values were erroring low
- Added Days graph                                                              
- Completely revamped date delta code using datetime built in functionality to calculate date/time ranges
- Re-architected graphing logic

- Added normalization code, better differentiation of close values, handles most edge cases              
- Made design decision to stay with simplicity (Separate Classes) for each type of graph. Imaging the graphing code more as report writing than object oriented programming and you will find my zen

* Tue Jul 31 2009 Scott McCarty <smccarty@eyemg.com>
- First working version
